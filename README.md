#Description :

Weather Dashboard : 
The Weather Dashboard is a modern, responsive web application developed using React.js as a part of the CodTech internship program. 
This project demonstrates core front-end development skills, including handling user input, integrating third-party APIs, managing application state, and creating dynamic user interfaces.


#Project Overview :
This application allows users to search for real-time weather data by entering the name of any city in the world. 
Upon entering a valid city name, the app fetches weather details from a public weather API (such as the OpenWeatherMap API) and displays relevant weather metrics, 
including:

Temperature (°C/°F)

Weather condition (clear, rain, clouds, etc.)

Humidity percentage

Wind speed

Weather icon representing current conditions

The main purpose of this project is to build a fully functional and interactive weather dashboard that not only demonstrates API integration and React state management 
but also delivers a seamless user experience with a clean and responsive UI design.



#Key Features :
Real-Time Data: Weather data is retrieved live from a reliable API source using fetch() or axios.

User Input Handling: Users can enter the city name in a search bar, which triggers the API call and updates the display.

Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

React Hooks: Uses useState and useEffect for state management and lifecycle methods.

Dynamic Rendering: Weather information and icons update dynamically based on user input.

Error Handling: Displays user-friendly error messages if the city is not found or if the API call fails.



#Tech Stack :
Frontend: React.js (with functional components and hooks), HTML5, CSS3

API: OpenWeatherMap or any other free weather API

Styling: Plain CSS

Version Control: Git & GitHub for source code management


#Conclusion :
The Weather Dashboard project is a beginner-friendly yet comprehensive React application that highlights the power of combining modern front-end frameworks with external APIs.
It serves as an excellent demonstration of web development skills and is a valuable addition to any intern’s portfolio. 
Upon successful completion, a certificate will be issued by CodTech on the internship’s official end date, recognizing your learning and contribution.
